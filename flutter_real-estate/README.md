#### 🎉🎉🎉V1.0 is here!🎉🎉🎉


## Getting Started

This project depends on the [`build_runner`](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) package for code generation, make sure to run `pub run build_runner build` on the root directory otherwise the project won't built as auto-generated files are not checked into VCS. 

After files has been generated by running `build_runner build` you may proceed as any other regular flutter project.

The map shown in the single page depends on mapbox_gl make sure to create a configuration file with your own [`mapbox`](https://www.mapbox.com/) api key at `lib/ui/widgets/info_map/config.secret.dart`

## App Architecture 🏨📏
* MVVM architecture
* Each layer only depends on the layer below
* Locator pattern is achieved by using [`get_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) package
* Data binding is achieved by using `ChangeNotifier` class and [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package

*Main code folders*

The **iu** folder contains all the flutter code, the only folder that depends on the **core** business logic is in lib>ui>containers, you may consider it as the glue between the business logic and the presentation layer
